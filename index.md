# Welcome to my notes

This site is based on my personal repository for security stuff and HTB Notes.

Use the navigation bar above or the links below to dive in:

## Organised Sections

- [**HTB Academy**](/htb-academy/): Structured notes for the major Hack The Box Academy learning paths (CPTS, AI Security, etc.).
- [**HTB Boxes**](/boxes/): Categorised notes from retired machines, sorted by difficulty.
